Unfortunatley the main data does not include county name but rather their own code for county. So I will join their codes with the county names and then use my counties.regions data to bring together the remaining regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK12OrganizationID\nOrganizationName\ncounty.name\ncountyfp\nDem_Desc\nedr\nedr.simple\n\n\n\n\n122745\nPERPICH CENTER FOR ARTS EDUCATION\nHennepin\n053\nEntirely urban\nEDR 11 - 7 County Twin Cities\nEDR 11\n\n\n172384\nAUSTIN SENIOR HIGH\nMower\n099\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 10 - Southeast\nEDR 10\n\n\n89982\nFRESHWATER ED.

Here’s how I will do that.\n\nPersonID: change to integer\nK12OrganizationID: change to integer.\nK12EnrTimeID: Change so it’s only the year\nGrade: eliminate - unimportant since we are mostly concerned about whether they graduated.\nEconomicStatusIndicator: I will change this to two categories. Whether they were ever eligible for reduce priced or free meal will be coded as 1 (eligible = codes 1, 2, 4, 5) at any point in the dataset. The remaining will be coded as 0.\nFederalRaceIndicator: eliminate - I’m going to use the RaceEthnicity column instead.\nPSEO columns: I’m most concerned about whether they participated in PSEO or not. A new column will be created indicated whether there was a “Y” coded for either the “PSEOConcurrentEnrollmentIndicator” or “PostSecondaryEnrollmentOptionsIndicator” columns at any point in the dataset. The two original columns will be eliminated.\nStatusEnd: I will only include individuals that have StatusEnd coded as an 8 or 9.\nGender: included and not changed.\nSpecialEdStatus: I will split this into two categories. The first is that a student did not require special education services (codes 1-2) at any point in the dataset. The other category will be that they require special education (codes 4 - 9) at any point in the dataset.\nLimited English: keep with no changes.\nPrimary language: I’m going to create two categories. One being that English is the primary language while the other will be that English is NOT the primary language at any point in the dataset.\nHomeless: Keep with no changes.\n\nWe first need to create a list of all individuals with the StatusEnd code of 8 or 9 (graduated). In addition, we need to remove any student that graduated before 2008. This is because we will not have their full Sophmore - Senior records which is especially important when attempting to identify whether the number of CTE courses taken predicts migration.\nThe other element I want to add is a pre-covid and post-covid variable. All individuals whose grad year is before 2020 will be labeled pre-covid and all others wil lbe post-covid.\nThis “graduates list” will be the list on which we will bind all the other variables.\n\n\nNext we need to create new columns for the variables that will indicate a certain status has been met at any point in the dataset for each PersonID. For example, we want a column that indicates a PersonID was enrolled in PSEO at some point in the dataset. The variables that need a new column created are;\n\nEconomicStatusIndicator\nPostSecondaryEnrollmentOptionsIndicator & PSEOConcurrentEnrollmentIndicator\nSpecialEdStatus\nHomeprimaryLanguage\n\n\n\nNow we can combine the list of graduates with the status indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nK12OrganizationID\nOrganizationName\ncounty.name\ncountyfp\nDem_Desc\nedr\ngrad.year\ngrad.year.covid\nGender\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\nHomelessIndicator\neconomic.status\npseo.participant\nSpecialEdStatus\nnon.english.home\nRaceEthnicity\n\n\n\n\n6140596\n15068\nCHERRY SECONDARY\nSt. Louis\n137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2017\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nY\n1\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n1986818\n207340\nALC Independent Study\nSt. Louis\n137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2022\nPost-covid grad\nM\nN\nY\n0\n0\n0\n0\nUnknown\n\n\n11614284\n217881\nGRAND RAPIDS SENIOR HIGH\nItasca\n061\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2023\nPost-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\n0\n0\n0\nUnknown\n\n\n8332752\n67509\nEAST HIGH SCHOOL\nSt. Louis\n137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2016\nPre-covid grad\nM\nN\nN\n0\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n6569729\n49396\nAITKIN SECONDARY SCHOOL\nAitkin\n001\nEntirely rural\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2012\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n357415\n184119\nWRENSHALL SECONDARY\nCarlton\n017\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2019\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nK12OrganizationID\n\n\nOrganizationName\n\n\ncounty.name\n\n\ncountyfp\n\n\nDem_Desc\n\n\nedr\n\n\ngrad.year\n\n\ngrad.year.covid\n\n\nGender\n\n\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\n\n\nHomelessIndicator\n\n\neconomic.status\n\n\npseo.participant\n\n\nSpecialEdStatus\n\n\nnon.english.home\n\n\nRaceEthnicity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prepped enrollment data has 49,743 observations and 17 columns.\n\n\n\nSummary of K12Enrollment data\nBelow is the percentage of total observations that;\n\nWere eligible for free or reduced lunch at some point in the dataset\nAre Female\nHave been homeless at some point in the dataset\nHad limited english proficiency at some point in the dataset\nHad non english speakders in home at some point in the dataset\nParticipated in a PSEO course at some point in the dataset.\nPct non white\n\nAs expected, nearly half (49.1%) of the observations are female.

This type of analysis involves stratifying and/or segmenting the predictor space into a number of simple regions. Essentially, it’s another way to see which independent variables play a role in if an individual has meaningful employment in the local region X. We will be using the independent variables that were identified as being important in the multiple correspondence analysis.\nThere are a number of states at which we categorize individuals in the dataset;\nThere are three “times” in which we checked to see if the individual had meaningful employment within these geographies;\nMeaningful employment is determined by whether an individual worked 1,000 hours for an employer during time X. In addition, if the individual is working for an employer but not meaningful at time X but worked 1,000 hours for that employer during another year it’s still considered “meaningful”.\nDue to time x potentially being passed the date of the latest data (2023) for some individuals, the analysis below will filter out all individuals where time x is after 2023.\nThe primary independent variables that the cross tables indicated as important are;\n$Gender\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$grad.year.covid\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$economic.status\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$range.school\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$pseo.participant\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$SpecialEdStatus\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$RaceEthnicity\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$Dem_Desc\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$took.ACT\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ap.exam\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$cte.achievement\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$english.learner\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ps.grad\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ps.grad.InstitutionSector\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$highest.cred.level\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ps.grad.location\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ACTCompositeScore\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$MCA.M\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$MCA.R\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$MCA.S\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$total.cte.courses.taken\n[1] \"numeric\""

The Train set is used for training and creating the model. The Test set is considered to be a dummy production environment to test predictions and evaluate the accuracy of the model.\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nsample_ind &lt;- sample(nrow(meaningful.emp.ne.grad.year.10), nrow(meaningful.emp.ne.grad.year.10) *.7)\n\ntrain &lt;- meaningful.emp.ne.grad.year.10[sample_ind,]\n\ntest &lt;- meaningful.emp.ne.grad.year.10[-sample_ind,]\n\nNext, we create a decision tree model by calling the rpart function. Let’s first create a base model with default parameters and value. The CP (complexity parameter) is used to control tree growth. If the cost of adding a variable is higher then the value of CP, then tree growth stops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification tree:\nrpart(formula = grad.year.10 ~ ., data = train, method = \"class\", \n    cp = 0)\n\nVariables actually used in tree construction:\n [1] ACTCompositeScore         ap.exam                  \n [3] cte.achievement           Dem_Desc                 \n [5] economic.status           english.learner          \n [7] Gender                    highest.cred.level       \n [9] MCA.M                     MCA.R                    \n[11] MCA.S                     ps.grad                  \n[13] ps.grad.InstitutionSector ps.grad.location         \n[15] pseo.participant          RaceEthnicity            \n[17] range.school              SpecialEdStatus          \n[19] took.ACT                  total.cte.courses.taken  \n\nRoot node error: 2414/13817 = 0.17471\n\nn= 13817 \n\n           CP nsplit rel error xerror     xstd\n1  9.6658e-04      0   1.00000 1.0000 0.018490\n2  7.7327e-04      3   0.99710 1.0153 0.018601\n3  6.9042e-04     38   0.96272 1.0195 0.018630\n4  6.2138e-04     41   0.96065 1.0215 0.018645\n5  5.5233e-04     49   0.95568 1.0228 0.018654\n6  4.1425e-04     52   0.95402 1.0249 0.018669\n7  3.7659e-04     56   0.95236 1.0385 0.018766\n8  3.1069e-04     72   0.94490 1.0510 0.018853\n9  2.9589e-04     76   0.94366 1.0592 0.018910\n10 2.7617e-04     83   0.94159 1.0626 0.018933\n11 2.4855e-04     89   0.93993 1.0688 0.018975\n12 2.0713e-04     97   0.93745 1.0804 0.019054\n13 1.7754e-04    109   0.93496 1.0882 0.019107\n14 1.6570e-04    131   0.92833 1.0949 0.019152\n15 1.3808e-04    146   0.92585 1.1102 0.019253\n16 1.1836e-04    184   0.92046 1.1160 0.019291\n17 1.0356e-04    205   0.91674 1.1210 0.019324\n18 8.2850e-05    213   0.91591 1.1247 0.019348\n19 6.9042e-05    239   0.91342 1.1363 0.019423\n20 5.9179e-05    257   0.91218 1.1421 0.019460\n21 4.6028e-05    264   0.91176 1.1433 0.019468\n22 4.1425e-05    273   0.91135 1.1433 0.019468\n23 0.0000e+00    283   0.91094 1.1454 0.019482\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting model produced a VERY complex tree with too many nodes that it isn’t interpretable.

are a number of “states” in which an individual in this dataset are assigned;\nThere are three “times” in which we checked to see if the individual had meaningful employment within these geographies;\nMeaningful employment is determined by whether an individual worked 1,000 hours for an employer during time X. In addition, if the individual is working for an employer but not meaningful at time X but worked 1,000 hours for that employer during another year it’s still considered “meaningful”.\nDue to time x potentially being passed the date of the latest data (2023) for some individuals, the analysis below will filter out all individuals where time x is after 2023.\nFrom the multiple correspondence analysis and the principle component analysis we determined that the following independent variables will be included in the analysis.\n$range.school\n[1] \"character\"\n\n$Gender\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$grad.year.covid\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$economic.status\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$pseo.participant\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$SpecialEdStatus\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$RaceEthnicity\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$Dem_Desc\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$took.ACT\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ap.exam\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$cte.achievement\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$english.learner\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$attended.ps.within.first.year.hsgrad\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$attended.ps\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ps.grad\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ps.grad.InstitutionSector\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$highest.cred.level\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ps.grad.in.same.ruca\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ps.grad.in.same.edr\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$ps.grad.in.MN\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n$n.years.attended\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$ACTCompositeScore\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$avg.unemp.rate\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$ACTE.SPED\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Agriculture..Food..and.Natural.Resources\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Architecture...Construction\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Arts..A.V.Technology...Communication\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Business..Management...Administrative\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Diversified\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Education...Training\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Finance\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Government...Public.Administration\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Health.Science\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Hospitality...Tourism\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Human.Services\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Information.Technology\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Law..Public.Safety...Security\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Manufacturing\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Marketing\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Program.Area..Diversified.\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Science..Technology..Engineering....Mathematics\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$STEM\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Transportation..Distribution...Logistics\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Work.Experience.Handicapped\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Work.Experience.Handicapped..16.20..on.IEP.\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Work.Experience.Career.Exploration..age.14.15.on.I\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Work.Experience.Disadvantaged\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Youth.Apprenticeship\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$MCA.M\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$MCA.R\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$MCA.S\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$n.institutions\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$avg.wages.pct.state\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$total.cte.courses.taken\n[1] \"numeric\""

Here are the columns and their definitions.\n\nEnrollmentBeginTimeID: Begin date for the student’s period of attendance.\nEnrollmentEndTimeID: End date for the student’s period of attendance.\nOPEID: Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE)/FICE code of the college that the student attended (Foreign Key to IPEDSCharacteristics).\nInstitutionName: Name of institution\nEnrollmentStatus: The last enrollment status reported for the student. This field will have ‘N/A’ or “NULL” if the reporting college has not defined the student’s enrollment status as directory information. Here are the code definitions;\n\nF: Full-time\nQ: Three-quarter time\nH: Half-time\nL: Less than half-time\nA: Leave of absence\nW: Withdrawn\nD: Deceased\n\n\nEssentially, this dataset provides semester-based information - each observation is a semester/single period with the institutional information and beginning and end time of that single period (usually a semester). For example, if an individual attended South Dakota State University, attended in a “typical” fashion (fall and spring semesters), and graduated in 4 years, there would be 8 observations for that PersonID - one observation per semester.\nThere are a few pieces of information that I want to consolidate from this dataset;\n\nDid the PersonID in the master dataset attend a college - yes or no?\nDid the PersonID attend college during high school (PSEO), immediately after graduation or wait?\nDid the PersonID attend multiple colleges - yes or no?\nWhat type of college did the PersonID attend first?\nDid the PersonID attend a public, private not-for-profit, or private or, for-profit college(s)?\nAt any point during their college career, did the PersonID attend a college(s) inside or outside of the Southwest Region or outside the EDR of their high school?\n\nI was going to include the length of time that a PersonID attended college, but due to differences in how institutions report enrollment periods, it didn’t seem like it would be a great indicator.\nThe pieces of information missing in the original dataset is location and type of institution attended.To do this we will need to join the original dataset with an IPEDS dataset using opeid.\nThe IPEDS data and the NSC data will only match using the first 6 digits of the IPEDS OPEID values. So I will change that in the NSC data. Then I can join.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nEnrollmentBeginTimeID\nEnrollmentEndTimeID\nOPEID\nEnrollmentStatus\nOPEID.6\nUnitid\nCity\nState\nFIPS\nGeographicRegion\nCountyCode\nInstitutionSector\nInstitutionName\n\n\n\n\n10025234\n20120103\n20120126\n00235400\nH\n002354\n173665\nSaint Paul\nMN\n27\n4\n27123\n2\nHamline University\n\n\n11364693\n20130122\n20130517\n00238881\nF\n002388\n174233\nDuluth\nMN\n27\n4\n27137\n1\nUniversity of Minnesota-Duluth\n\n\n3090532\n20090824\n20091218\n00238300\nF\n002383\n174862\nSaint Bonifacius\nMN\n27\n4\n27019\n2\nCrown College\n\n\n11127041\n20200601\n20200819\n00238200\nL\n002382\n174844\nNorthfield\nMN\n27\n4\n27131\n2\nSt Olaf College\n\n\n4465956\n20100823\n20101217\n00299700\nF\n002997\n200332\nFargo\nND\n38\n4\n38017\n1\nNorth Dakota State University-Main Campus\n\n\n9191392\n20110110\n20110513\n00553400\nL\n005534\n174756\nSaint Cloud\nMN\n27\n4\n27145\n4\nSt Cloud Technical and Community College\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nEnrollmentBeginTimeID\n\n\nEnrollmentEndTimeID\n\n\nOPEID\n\n\nEnrollmentStatus\n\n\nOPEID.6\n\n\nUnitid\n\n\nCity\n\n\nState\n\n\nFIPS\n\n\nGeographicRegion\n\n\nCountyCode\n\n\nInstitutionSector\n\n\nInstitutionName\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter joining these we now have 3,009,843 rows and 14 columns. This is a few less than the original enrollment document due to a few OPEIDs not aligning.

This dataset now provides the sector of the first post-secondary institution they attended immediately after college.\nNext we will determine thy type(s) of college(s) they attended during their post-secondary career. To do this we will first create a dataset with columns for each institution sector and a confirmation indicator on whether the PersonID attended that particular sector at some point in their career. I will then create a new category indicating that attended more than one type of institution sector. Once completed, I will be left with a dataset that has a column for each unique PersonID and what sector they attended, as well as a newly created code for “attended more than 1 type of sector”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nps.sector.1\nps.sector.2\nps.sector.3\nps.sector.4\nps.sector.5\nps.sector.6\nps.sector.7\nps.sector.8\nps.sector.9\n\n\n\n\n227\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n240\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n406\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n429\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n768\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1241\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nps.sector.1\n\n\nps.sector.2\n\n\nps.sector.3\n\n\nps.sector.4\n\n\nps.sector.5\n\n\nps.sector.6\n\n\nps.sector.7\n\n\nps.sector.8\n\n\nps.sector.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, we have 49,743 rows and 10 columns. This dataset provides each unique PersonID with the institution sector they attended using the codes listed above. For PersonID’s that attended multiple sectors, they were coded as “10”.\nNext we will determine whether they attended a post-secondary institution inside or outside of the planning region, outside their EDR, or outside of Minnesota. Since many of the PersonID in the dataset have attended multiple institutions, we will categorize it in the following way in order to capture the combinations of attendance;\n\nAttended inside region only (planning region, EDR, RUCA, State)\nAttended inside and outside region (planning region, EDR, RUCA, state)\nAttended outside region only (planning region, EDR, RUCA, state)\n\nIn order to do this we will need to combine our planning region and EDR joining documents with the nsc.enrollment.ipeds dataset. We will also need to join the master dataset with it to determine the location of the PersonID’s high school graduation location. Lastly, we will need to join up the RUCA categories for counties outside of Minnesota. Then we can start the categorization process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nInstitutionName\nCountyCode\nps.Dem_Desc\ngrad.edr\ngrad.ruca\ngrad.pr\nps.countyfp\nps.statefp\nps.edr\nps.pr\n\n\n\n\n11364693\nUniversity of Minnesota-Duluth\n27137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n137\n27\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nNortheast\n\n\n11127041\nSt Olaf College\n27131\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n131\n27\nEDR 10 - Southeast\nSoutheast\n\n\n10554185\nQuinsigamond Community College\n25027\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n027\n25\nNA\nNA\n\n\n4577203\nUniversity of St Thomas\n27123\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n123\n27\nEDR 11 - 7 County Twin Cities\nSeven County Mpls-St Paul\n\n\n5456903\nLake Superior College\n27137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n137\n27\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nNortheast\n\n\n1607818\nCentral Lakes College-Brainerd\n27035\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nTown/rural mix\nNortheast\n035\n27\nEDR 5 - North Central\nNorthwest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nInstitutionName\n\n\nCountyCode\n\n\nps.Dem_Desc\n\n\ngrad.edr\n\n\ngrad.ruca\n\n\ngrad.pr\n\n\nps.countyfp\n\n\nps.statefp\n\n\nps.edr\n\n\nps.pr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis joined dataset gives us 245,812 rows and 11 columns. The columns beginning with “ps” are the ruca category and regions of the post-secondary institution attended. The columns beginning with “grad” are the ruca category and regions of the highschool from which the PersonID graduated.\nOne thing that’s important is to realize that joining the nsc.enrollment dataset with the SW graduates dataset means we will have some NAs. Some of the students listed in the nsc.enrollment dataset aren’t in the SW graduates dataset since they may have graduated before 2008 or didn’t actually meet the criteria in the SW graduates dataset. Therefore, as we move forward, I will need to make sure to remove those NAs.\nFrom here we can start creating new columns beginning with the RUCA category. to create this column we will gather each PersonID to examine whether or they attended a post-secondary institution in the same RUCA category, or if they attended multiple post-secondary insitutions with one institution in the same category and another not the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nps.in.same.ruca\n\n\n\n\n227\nIn same RUCA\n\n\n406\nOutside RUCA\n\n\n429\nInside and outside same RUCA\n\n\n768\nOutside RUCA\n\n\n1241\nIn same RUCA\n\n\n1276\nInside and outside same RUCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nps.in.same.ruca\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there are fewer observations in this dataset than previous subsets. Why? This is due to dropping and PersonID that wasn’t in the Southwest graduate dataset. I did not do that for the previous subsets. However, those previous subsets will be filtered down once we join it with the master dataset.\nThis dataset provides the PersonID and whether they attended a post secondary institution in a location with the same, outside, or both outside and inside (if attended multiple post-secondary institutions) RUCA categories of their high school from which they graduated. There are 34,745 rows and 2 columns.\nUp next we will create a dataset indicating whether a PersonID that graduated from a Southwest MN high school attended a post-secondary insitution in their high school’s EDR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nps.in.same.edr\n\n\n\n\n227\nOutside EDR\n\n\n406\nOutside EDR\n\n\n429\nInside and outside same EDR\n\n\n768\nIn same EDR\n\n\n1241\nIn same EDR\n\n\n1276\nInside and outside same EDR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nps.in.same.edr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected there are 34,745 rows and 2 columns.\nNext we will determine which Southwest MN graduates attended a post-secondary institution in the same planning region (Southwest planning region).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nps.in.same.pr\n\n\n\n\n227\nOutside PR\n\n\n406\nOutside PR\n\n\n429\nInside and outside same PR\n\n\n768\nIn same PR\n\n\n1241\nIn same PR\n\n\n1276\nInside and outside same PR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nps.in.same.pr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, there are 34,745 rows and 2 columns.

The biggest difference is that graduates from a town/rural mix district attend at a lower rate - 67.1% compared to 69.5% and 69.8%.\n\n\nChart - RUCACross-tabs - RUCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n   Cell Contents\n|-------------------------|\n|                       N |\n|              Expected N |\n|           N / Row Total |\n|-------------------------|\n\n \nTotal Observations in Table:  49743 \n\n \n                     | master.9$attended.ps \n   master.9$Dem_Desc |        No |       Yes | Row Total | \n---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n      Entirely rural |       960 |      1966 |      2926 | \n                     |   939.746 |  1986.254 |           | \n                     |     0.328 |     0.672 |     0.059 | \n---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n      Town/rural mix |      4052 |      7754 |     11806 | \n                     |  3791.743 |  8014.257 |           | \n                     |     0.343 |     0.657 |     0.237 | \n---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\nUrban/town/rural mix |     10964 |     24047 |     35011 | \n                     | 11244.512 | 23766.488 |           | \n                     |     0.313 |     0.687 |     0.704 | \n---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n        Column Total |     15976 |     33767 |     49743 | \n---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n\n \nStatistics for All Table Factors\n\n\nPearson's Chi-squared test \n------------------------------------------------------------\nChi^2 =  37.26688     d.f. =  2     p =  8.083518e-09 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of years between graduation and attending post-secondary\nNow lets take a look at the number of years between high school graduation and attending post-secondary.

However, in the TukeyHSD test, it only shows that the statistically significant difference exists between urban/town/rural mix and town/rural mix districts.\nIt says that graduates from urban/town/rural districts wait to attent post-secondary institution .05 years longer than town/rural mix districts.\n\n\nRUCA - TableRUCA - Cross-tabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)  \nDem_Desc        2      7   3.418   3.543 0.0289 *\nResiduals   33764  32571   0.965                 \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = attended.ps.years.hsgrad ~ Dem_Desc, data = years.between.grad.ps.anova.ruca)\n\n$Dem_Desc\n                                           diff          lwr         upr\nTown/rural mix-Entirely rural       -0.05678846 -0.114914609 0.001337683\nUrban/town/rural mix-Entirely rural -0.02927272 -0.083269279 0.024723834\nUrban/town/rural mix-Town/rural mix  0.02751574 -0.002546413 0.057577894\n                                        p adj\nTown/rural mix-Entirely rural       0.0572259\nUrban/town/rural mix-Entirely rural 0.4118632\nUrban/town/rural mix-Town/rural mix 0.0809540\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of number of colleges attended\nNext we will summarize the number of colleges attended by producing the summary statistics and distribution.\nThe table and distribution chart below show that a large majority (57.1%) of individuals attended only one post secondary institutions followed by 28% attending two.\n\n\nSummary StatsDistribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m not sure it’s all that important knowing whether there are differences in the percentage of students and the number of institutions they’ve attended across RUCA categories or regions. So we will skip that analysis for now.\n\n\n\nSummary of types of first college attended\nI think this will be very interesting - we want to see what they breakdown is of students attending different types of colleges. We will start by summarizing the total dataset before looking at differences across RUCA categories and regions.\nThe chart below provides the percentage of students in the entire dataset that attended each institution sector. By far, a huge majority attend either a public 4-year (31%) or public 2-year (53%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we will check to see if those percentages are significantly different by RUCA category of the graduates high school.\nThe crosstabs indicate that there is a significant difference in the percentage of students attending different institution sectors depending on the RUCA category of their high school. The p-value was 2.573119e-22.\nThe primary differences are;\n\nTown/rural mix high school graduates attended public, 2-year institutions at a significantly higher rate than entirely rural and urban/town/rural mix students.\nEntirely rural and urban/town/rural mix graduates attend private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions at a higher rate.\n\n\n\nChart - RUCACross-tabs - RUCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n   Cell Contents\n|-------------------------|\n|                       N |\n|              Expected N |\n|           N / Row Total |\n|-------------------------|\n\n \nTotal Observations in Table:  33634 \n\n \n                                        | first.college.sector.ct.1.ruca$first.InstitutionSector \nfirst.college.sector.ct.1.ruca$Dem_Desc |         1 |         2 |         3 |         4 | Row Total | \n----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n                         Entirely rural |       588 |       312 |        12 |      1035 |      1947 | \n                                        |   615.464 |   290.713 |    12.851 |  1027.972 |           | \n                                        |     0.302 |     0.160 |     0.006 |     0.532 |     0.058 | \n----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n                         Town/rural mix |      2335 |       884 |        64 |      4448 |      7731 | \n                                        |  2443.836 |  1154.340 |    51.028 |  4081.795 |           | \n                                        |     0.302 |     0.114 |     0.008 |     0.575 |     0.230 | \n----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n                   Urban/town/rural mix |      7709 |      3826 |       146 |     12275 |     23956 | \n                                        |  7572.700 |  3576.947 |   158.121 | 12648.232 |           | \n                                        |     0.322 |     0.160 |     0.006 |     0.512 |     0.712 | \n----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n                           Column Total |     10632 |      5022 |       222 |     17758 |     33634 | \n----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n\n \nStatistics for All Table Factors\n\n\nPearson's Chi-squared test \n------------------------------------------------------------\nChi^2 =  138.937     d.f. =  6     p =  1.679834e-27 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of attending college with same RUCA category\nUp next is determining how many students attended a post-secondary institution located in a county with the same RUCA category as their high school. First we will look at the percentages of the total dataset and then we will break it up.\nThe chart below shows that nearly half (56.3%) of students graduating from a NE MN high school attended a post secondary institution that was located in a county with the same RUCA category as their high school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lets check to see if the type of RUCA category they graduated from is related to whether the college they attend is in the same or different RUCA category.\nThe crosstabs indicate that there is a relationship in the location of the individuals high school graduation and the RUCA category of their post-secondary institution(s). The p-valu was 0.\nAs expected, individuals who graduate from a high school in an entirely rural county category were significantly more likely to attend a post secondary institution that wasn’t entirely rural (100% actually). Individuals that graduated from a school districte located in a Urban/town/rural mix county were significantly more likely to attend a college in the same RUCA category.\n\n\nChart - RUCACross-tabs - RUCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n   Cell Contents\n|-------------------------|\n|                       N |\n|              Expected N |\n|           N / Row Total |\n|-------------------------|\n\n \nTotal Observations in Table:  33766 \n\n \n                              | ps.same.ruca.ct.ruca$ps.in.same.ruca \nps.same.ruca.ct.ruca$Dem_Desc |                 In same RUCA | Inside and outside same RUCA |                 Outside RUCA |                    Row Total | \n------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n               Entirely rural |                            0 |                            2 |                         1964 |                         1966 | \n                              |                     1056.828 |                      388.414 |                      520.758 |                              | \n                              |                        0.000 |                        0.001 |                        0.999 |                        0.058 | \n------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n               Town/rural mix |                         1724 |                         2135 |                         3895 |                         7754 | \n                              |                     4168.183 |                     1531.924 |                     2053.894 |                              | \n                              |                        0.222 |                        0.275 |                        0.502 |                        0.230 | \n------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n         Urban/town/rural mix |                        16427 |                         4534 |                         3085 |                        24046 | \n                              |                    12925.989 |                     4750.662 |                     6369.349 |                              | \n                              |                        0.683 |                        0.189 |                        0.128 |                        0.712 | \n------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n                 Column Total |                        18151 |                         6671 |                         8944 |                        33766 | \n------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n\n \nStatistics for All Table Factors\n\n\nPearson's Chi-squared test \n------------------------------------------------------------\nChi^2 =  11413.82     d.f. =  4     p =  0 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of attending college in same planning region as high school\nNow we want to see how many students attend a college that is located in the same planning region as their high school.\nThe chart below shows that nearly 44% of students graduating from NE MN High schools leave the region to attend post secondary education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of attending college in Minnesota\nNow we want to see how many students stay or leave Minnesota to attend college.\nThe chart below shows that 59% of students graduating from SW MN high schools attend a post secondary institution in Minnesota.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lets check to see if the RUCA category of their high school is related to whether they attend a college inside or outside Minnesota.\nThe crosstabs below indicate that there is a relationship between the RUCA category of a student’s high school and whether they attend a college inside or outside of Minnesota.

Each observation represents an AP exam taken so this means that a PersonID can be listed multiple times if the individual took multiple AP exams. The ExamGrade is on a 1 - 5 scale with the highest scores being better. According to Meredith at OHE, colleges give credit if the score is 3 or higher.\nI’m a bit torn here. There seems to be three approaches to how I can utilize this data in the model.\n\nI could either just create a category of whether an individual took an AP exam and not care what the grade was.\nI could only use individuals who scored 3 or higher.\nI could keep all the data and change it so that each observation represents a PersonID and new columns created for each AP exam and their score.\n\nFor now, I think I’m going to just utilize option 1 - whether they took an AP exam or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nap.exam\n\n\n\n\n3066282\n1\n\n\n1058834\n1\n\n\n10408742\n1\n\n\n6430656\n1\n\n\n956925\n1\n\n\n872685\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nap.exam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated AP dataset shows that 108,858 took at least one AP exam.

Although, nearly 10% of all students took the AP exam, only 2.1% from town/rural mix districts took the exam compared to 9.3% from our entirely rural districts and 11.7% from our urban/town/rural mix districts.\n\n\nRUCA TableRUCA Cross-tabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n   Cell Contents\n|-------------------------|\n|                       N |\n|              Expected N |\n|           N / Row Total |\n|-------------------------|\n\n \nTotal Observations in Table:  49743 \n\n \n                           | ap.crosstabs.ruca$ap.exam \nap.crosstabs.ruca$Dem_Desc | Did not take AP exam |         Took AP exam |            Row Total | \n---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n            Entirely rural |                 2729 |                  197 |                 2926 | \n                           |             2670.829 |              255.171 |                      | \n                           |                0.933 |                0.067 |                0.059 | \n---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n            Town/rural mix |                11433 |                  373 |                11806 | \n                           |            10776.419 |             1029.581 |                      | \n                           |                0.968 |                0.032 |                0.237 | \n---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n      Urban/town/rural mix |                31243 |                 3768 |                35011 | \n                           |            31957.752 |             3053.248 |                      | \n                           |                0.892 |                0.108 |                0.704 | \n---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n              Column Total |                45405 |                 4338 |                49743 | \n---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n\n \nStatistics for All Table Factors\n\n\nPearson's Chi-squared test \n------------------------------------------------------------\nChi^2 =  656.5505     d.f. =  2     p =  2.703094e-143 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is significant variation in the percent of students who’ve taken an AP exam across counties.

    "text": "Filter for “meaningful” employment\nThe biggest issue is how do we get a meaningful indicator on whether they were employed in the region and whether they are employed in an industry that matches their CTE experience that wasn’t just a “summer job”. We need to filter out summer jobs between college years, as well as adapt to different paths that students take.\nWe will define “meaningful employment” as an employment experience in which an individual works for one particular employer for 1,000 hours worked in any given year.\nHowever, this isn’t going to just be checking to see if an individual has worked at an employer for 1,000 hours at graduation year, grad year +2, grad year +7 and grad year +12. Rather, it’s going to be checking on whether they are working at an employer at grad year, grad year +2, grad year +7 and grad year +12 for which they worked 1,000 hours for an given year.\nFor example, a person may be employed with an employer for a few years working full-time, but part-way through grad year +7, they decide to move on. I want to make sure we capture that that individual was employed in meaningful employment even though it wasn’t full-time that particular year.\nThe same can go the other way. Perhaps an individual just starts employment at grad year +7 but does work full-time with that particular employer form multiple years.

    "text": "High school grad and employment instance match\nFirst, let’s look what percentage of individuals had an employment instance where the employer was located in the same county as their high school.\nThe table below shows that 17% of the individuals in the master dataset had meaningful employment in the same county as their high school the year they graduated. It increased to 25% two years after graduation and then 31% seven years after graduation. These percentages are after filtering out all of the “After 2019” category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s check the differences by RUCA category.\nCrosstabs indicate a relationship.\n\nhs.grad.year: Not a huge difference, but urban/town/rural mix have a slightly higher percentage of graduates with meaningful employment in the same county as their high school.\nhs.grad.year.2: Urban/town/rural mix districts have a significantly higher percentage of individuals with meaningful employment in the same county as their high school - 27% vs. 20% for the other RUCA county groups.\nhs.grad.year.7: Urban/town/rural mix districts continue to have a significantly higher percentage of individuals with meaningful employment in the same county as their high school.\n\n\n\nRUCA - Chart pctRUCA -

We will want to continue to do the same. So we need to create an employment dataset with the following columns;\n\nPersonID\nHigh school graduation year\nWhether the individual had an employment record the year of, and each subsequent year, of high school graduation.\nHow many years after graduation each employment check is (i.e. grad.year.1, grad.year.2,….etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nhs.grad.year\n\n\nCalendarYear\n\n\nmn.emp.record\n\n\ngrad.year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nhs.grad.year\nCalendarYear\nmn.emp.record\ngrad.year\n\n\n\n\n227\n2011\n2011\nNo MN emp record\ngrad.year.0\n\n\n227\n2011\n2012\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.1\n\n\n227\n2011\n2013\nNo MN emp record\ngrad.year.2\n\n\n227\n2011\n2014\nNo MN emp record\ngrad.year.3\n\n\n227\n2011\n2015\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.4\n\n\n227\n2011\n2016\nNo MN emp record\ngrad.year.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset above provides each unique PersonID from our master list along with each possible grad year and subsequent years (grad.year.0, grad.year.1, grad.year.2 … grad.year.11).\nHere is the logic;\n\ngrad.year.x &gt; 2019: mn.emp.record == “After 2019”,\nif there’s a MN employment record for the PersonID and the grad.year.x: mn.emp.record == “MN emp record”\nif there’s no MN employment record for the PersonID and the grad.year.x: mn.emp.record == “No MN emp record”\n\nThere are 795,888 rows in this dataset with 49,743 individuals.\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest issue is how do we get a meaningful indicator on whether they were employed in the region and whether they are employed in an industry that matches their CTE experience that wasn’t just a “summer job”. We need to filter out summer jobs between college years, as well as adapt to different paths that students take.\nWe will define “meaningful employment” as an employment experience in which an individual works for one particular employer for 1,000 hours worked in any given year.\nThis will be a couple step process. First we will build a dataset that has each grad.year.x from each PersonID high school graduation year and match it with the MN employment records. We will end up with each PersonID having each grad.year.x along with wither they have a MN employment record, whether they had meaningful employment, whether grad.year.x is after 2019, or whether they have no MN employment record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nEmploymentOrganizationID\nCalendarYear\nAnnualHoursWorked\nhs.grad.year\nmn.emp.record\ngrad.year\nnew.mn.emp.record\nmeaningful.emp.code\n\n\n\n\n227\n5211\n2012\n198\n2011\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.1\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n227\n246506\n2015\n241\n2011\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.4\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n768\n1619\n2024\n200\n2013\nAfter 2023\ngrad.year.11\nAfter 2023\n0\n\n\n768\n4663\n2022\n595\n2013\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.9\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n768\n5972\n2014\n17\n2013\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.1\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n768\n58552\n2015\n798\n2013\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.2\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nEmploymentOrganizationID\n\n\nCalendarYear\n\n\nAnnualHoursWorked\n\n\nhs.grad.year\n\n\nmn.emp.record\n\n\ngrad.year\n\n\nnew.mn.emp.record\n\n\nmeaningful.emp.code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset has 795,888 rows where each row represents a grad.year.x and whether the PersonID had the following;\n\nmeaningful employment\nmn employment record but not meaningful employment\nemployment calendar year was after 2019, and\nhad no MN employment record.\n\nAlong with each of these is the Employment Organization ID which we can now join to see the lcoation of the meaningful employment.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we want to determine if the locations of meaningful employment match the counties and regions from which they graduated high school.

This confirmation is for each x-time of graduation year - graduation year, one year after graduation, 2 years after graduation … 11 years after graduation.\nThe final dataset gives us 795,888 rows and 8 columns."

We will end up with each PersonID having each grad.year.x along with wither they have a MN employment record, whether they had meaningful employment, whether grad.year.x is after 2019, or whether they have no MN employment record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nEmploymentOrganizationID\nCalendarYear\nAnnualHoursWorked\nhs.grad.year\nmn.emp.record\ngrad.year\nnew.mn.emp.record\nmeaningful.emp.code\n\n\n\n\n227\n5211\n2012\n198\n2011\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.1\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n227\n246506\n2015\n241\n2011\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.4\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n768\n1619\n2024\n200\n2013\nAfter 2023\ngrad.year.11\nAfter 2023\n0\n\n\n768\n4663\n2022\n595\n2013\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.9\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n768\n5972\n2014\n17\n2013\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.1\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n768\n58552\n2015\n798\n2013\nMN emp record\ngrad.year.2\nMN emp record - not meaningful\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nEmploymentOrganizationID\n\n\nCalendarYear\n\n\nAnnualHoursWorked\n\n\nhs.grad.year\n\n\nmn.emp.record\n\n\ngrad.year\n\n\nnew.mn.emp.record\n\n\nmeaningful.emp.code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset has 795,888 rows where each row represents a grad.year.x and whether the PersonID had the following;\n\nmeaningful employment\nmn employment record but not meaningful employment\nemployment calendar year was after 2019, and\nhad no MN employment record.\n\nAlong with each of these is the Employment Organization ID which we can now join to see the lcoation of the meaningful employment."

This dataset only provides students that have a “Y” in the column.\nGraduationTimeID: Provides the yearmonthday of the PersonID graduation.\nOPEID: ID of the institution which has been converted to an 8 long string padded with “0” on the left.\nInstitutionName: Name of the institution from which the PersonID graduated.\nDegreeTitle: The Degree Title the PersonID graduated with. This column is a shitshow - some have values of BA, while others have it written out - Bachelor of Arts. I will need to fix this.\nMajor - Major the PersonID graduated with.\nOPEID.6 - this is the OPEID with a string length of 6 so that it matches up with our IPEDS dataset.\n\nThe main characteristics from this dataset that I want to add to the master dataset/model are the following;\n\nConfirmation that they graduated from a post secondary institution\nThe year they graduated from their first post secondary institution\nThe year they graduated from their last post-seconary institution\nThe sector of the institution(s) from which they graduated\nThe highest level of degree obtained by the PersonID\nThe degrees earned\nWhether the institution(s) from which they graduated are in the same RUCA category, EDR, planning region, and state as their high school\n\nOkay, lets first create a dataset with a unique PersonID and a column confirming that they graduated from a post secondary institution. However, we don’t want to include any students that never had a chance to complete their post-secondary institution. For example, if an individual has graduated by 2023 (the last year of the data), but is attending, then they shouldn’t be counted against the region for not having that person not “graduated”.\nEssentially, what we want to identify is that in 2023, has the individual;\n\nGraduated from a post-secondary institution,\nIs still attending post-secondary institution,\nNot attending post-secondary and never graduated from one.\n\nTo do this, I will need to import the NSC enrollment data, filter to 2023, and double check to see if anyone in our graduate list was attending post-secondary that year. Then ps.grad can be categorized as the following;\n\nps.grad: graduated from a post-secondary institution by 2023\nps.attending: attending post-secondary as of 2023\nnot.ps.grad: never graduated from a post-secondary institution and wasn’t enrolled in one as of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nGraduated\n\n\n\n\n82769\nY\n\n\n83179\nY\n\n\n83183\nY\n\n\n83438\nY\n\n\n83526\nY\n\n\n85029\nY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nGraduated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset has 18,724 rows and 2 columns. The dataset is a list of distinct PersonID in the original dataset along with a confirmation column that they graduated from a post-secondary institution. Essentially, this is how many individuals in the original dataset graduated from a post-secondary institution.\nNext, lets try and see if we can figure out the firs and last year they graduated from a first post-secondary institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nmin.ps.grad.year\nmax.ps.grad.year\n\n\n\n\n82769\n2021\n2021\n\n\n83179\n2017\n2017\n\n\n83183\n2013\n2013\n\n\n83438\n2012\n2012\n\n\n83526\n2017\n2017\n\n\n85029\n2022\n2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nmin.ps.grad.year\n\n\nmax.ps.grad.year\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, this dataset has 18,724 rows and 3 columns. This dataset provides each distinct PersonID’s year they received their first and last diploma/degrees.\nNext we will determine the sector(s) of the institution(s) from which they graduated. If they graduated from multiple institutions with different sectors than a new category will be created defined as “Graduated from multiple institution sectors”. This will be coded as “10”. I will use the IPEDS sector data. Here are the definitions of the institution sector;\n\n0 - Administrative Unit\n\n1 - Public, 4-year or above\n\n2 - Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above\n\n3 - Private for-profit, 4-year or above\n\n4 - Public, 2-year\n\n5 - Private not-for-profit, 2-year\n\n6 - Private for-profit, 2-year\n\n7 - Public, less-than 2-year\n\n8 - Private not-for-profit, less-than 2-year\n\n9 - Private for-profit, less-than 2-year\n\n10 - Multiple sectors\n99 - Sector unknown (not active)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nInstitutionSector\n\n\n\n\n227\n2\n\n\n406\n4\n\n\n768\n4\n\n\n1276\n1\n\n\n2432\n1\n\n\n3681\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nInstitutionSector\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset has 18,719 rows which is one fewer than previous subsets of the original. This is due to one PersonID having “NULL” in their InstitutionSector. This dataset now provides the institution sector from which each PersonID graduated. If they graduated from multiple different sectors than it was labeled as “10”.\nNext we will create a subset that provides the highest credential earned by each PersonID. As mentioned earlier, the DegreeTitle column is a mess, so I’m going to import a crosswalk table that will match the strings inputted by institutions into 9 categories. They are\n\nAD - Associate Degree\nBD - Bachelors Degree\nCR - Certificate\nDP - Doctoral-Professional\nDR - Doctorate Research\nMD - Masters Degree\nPC - PostBach Certificate\nPD - Diploma\nUC - Certificate\n\nI’m going to combine these into just a few categories.\n\nLess than associate degree = CR, PD, UC\nAssociate degree = AD\nBachelors Degree = BD, PC\nHigher than Bachelors Degree = MD, DP, DR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nhighest.cred.level\n\n\n\n\n82769\nAssociate degree\n\n\n83179\nBachelor degree\n\n\n83183\nBachelor degree\n\n\n83438\nBachelor degree\n\n\n83526\nBachelor degree\n\n\n85029\nAssociate degree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nhighest.cred.level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, we have 18,724 rows. This dataset provides the highest credential level earned for each PersonID.\nNext we will determine whether they graduated from a post-secondary institution inside or outside of the planning region, outside their EDR, or outside of Minnesota. Since many of the PersonID in the dataset have attended multiple institutions, we will categorize it in the following way in order to capture the combinations of attendance;\n\nGraduated inside region only (planning region, EDR, RUCA, State)\nGraduated inside and outside region (planning region, EDR, RUCA, state)\nGraduated outside region only (planning region, EDR, RUCA, state)\n\nIn order to do this we will need to combine our planning region and EDR joining documents with the nsccompletions.ipeds dataset. We will also need to join the master dataset with it to determine the location of the PersonID’s high school graduation location. Lastly, we will need to join up the RUCA categories for counties outside of Minnesota. Then we can start the categorization process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nInstitutionName\nCountyCode\nps.grad.Dem_Desc\nhs.grad.edr\nhs.grad.ruca\nhs.grad.pr\nps.grad.countyfp\nps.grad.statefp\nps.grad.edr\nps.grad.pr\n\n\n\n\n82769\nMesabi Range College\n27137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n137\n27\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nNortheast\n\n\n83179\nWashington State University\n53075\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n075\n53\nNA\nNA\n\n\n83183\nThe College of Saint Scholastica\n27137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n137\n27\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nNortheast\n\n\n83438\nUniversity of North Dakota\n38035\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n035\n38\nNA\nNA\n\n\n83526\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Superior\n55031\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nUrban/town/rural mix\nNortheast\n031\n55\nNA\nNA\n\n\n85029\nHibbing Community College\n27137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nTown/rural mix\nNortheast\n137\n27\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\nNortheast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nInstitutionName\n\n\nCountyCode\n\n\nps.grad.Dem_Desc\n\n\nhs.grad.edr\n\n\nhs.grad.ruca\n\n\nhs.grad.pr\n\n\nps.grad.countyfp\n\n\nps.grad.statefp\n\n\nps.grad.edr\n\n\nps.grad.pr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis joined dataset gives us 26,121 rows and 11 columns.

We will first look at the percentage from the total dataset and then break it up by RUCA category and regions to see if there are any significant differences.\nThe table below shows that the number of individuals that graduated from a post-secondary institution by 2023 was 37% while 18% were still attending a post-secondary institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lets check to see if there are differences by RUCA category.\nThe crosstabs below do not indicate a relationship as the p-value is .171.\n\n\nChart- RUCACross-tabs - RUCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n   Cell Contents\n|-------------------------|\n|                       N |\n|              Expected N |\n|           N / Row Total |\n|-------------------------|\n\n \nTotal Observations in Table:  49743 \n\n \n                     | master.10$ps.grad \n  master.10$Dem_Desc | Attending ps |           No |            Y |    Row Total | \n---------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n      Entirely rural |          307 |         1593 |         1026 |         2926 | \n                     |      339.111 |     1485.500 |     1101.390 |              | \n                     |        0.105 |        0.544 |        0.351 |        0.059 | \n---------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n      Town/rural mix |         1231 |         6163 |         4412 |        11806 | \n                     |     1368.265 |     5993.783 |     4443.953 |              | \n                     |        0.104 |        0.522 |        0.374 |        0.237 | \n---------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\nUrban/town/rural mix |         4227 |        17498 |        13286 |        35011 | \n                     |     4057.624 |    17774.718 |    13178.658 |              | \n                     |        0.121 |        0.500 |        0.379 |        0.704 | \n---------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n        Column Total |         5765 |        25254 |        18724 |        49743 | \n---------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n\n \nStatistics for All Table Factors\n\n\nPearson's Chi-squared test \n------------------------------------------------------------\nChi^2 =  47.01043     d.f. =  4     p =  1.517303e-09 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of years between graduations\nNext we will summarize the number of years between high school graduation and the first credential earned after high school.\nWe will start out with the total dataset before moving on to see if there are any statistically significant differences by RUCA category and region.\nThe table below provides summary statistics of the number of years between high school graduation and earning of their first credential after high school. The average was 3 years with a median of 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext lets see if these averages are significantly different across RUCA categories.\nThe ANOVA table indicates a relationship between the average number of years between high school graduation and earning first credential by RUCA category.\nThe primary trend is that the average number of years between high school graduation and earning first credential increases as a high school becomes more urban - 3.10 years for town/rural mix students and 3.41 for urban/town/rural mix students.\n\n\nChart - RUCAANOVA - RUCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \nDem_Desc        2    200  100.10   42.41 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   18721  44191    2.36                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = years.between.grads ~ Dem_Desc, data = years.between.grads.summary.ruca)\n\n$Dem_Desc\n                                          diff         lwr        upr     p adj\nTown/rural mix-Entirely rural       -0.1059029 -0.23071774 0.01891191 0.1149794\nUrban/town/rural mix-Entirely rural  0.1364860  0.01980036 0.25317161 0.0168445\nUrban/town/rural mix-Town/rural mix  0.2423889  0.17981616 0.30496165 0.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of post-secondary graduate sector\nNext we will take a look at the percentage of students that graduated by institution sector. We will start with the total dataset and then look to see if there are any statistical differences on the RUCA category and EDR of their high school from which they graduated.\nFirst, let’s look at it from a total dataset. Of the over 10,000 individuals that attended post-secondary in the dataset, nearly 40% went to a public, 2-year college, 31% went to a 4-year public college, 16% went to a private 4-year, and 14% graduated from a mixture of institution types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext lets see if the RUCA category from where they graduated high school makes any significant difference in the post-secondary institution from which they received a degree.\nThe crosstabs indicates a relationship between the RUCA location of their high school and the institution type from which they received a degree.\nThe table shows 3 significant differences.\n\nEntirely rural:\n\nSignificantly less likely to attend a 4-year public university\nSignificantly more likely to attend a 4-year, for-profit\nSignificantly more likely to attend a 2-year, for-profit\n\nTown/rural mix\n\nSignificantly less likely to attend a not-for-profit 4-year\nSignificantly more likely to attend colleges in multiple sectors\nSignificantly less likely to attend 2-year for-profits\n\n\n\n\nChart -

Each observation is an ACT test taken by a student in Southwest Minnesota. The unique feature here is the time it was taken. This means that a student could have taken the ACT twice and their PersonID would show up as two observations.\nOut of the scores provided, I’m just going to use the composite score. Since an individual may have taken the test multiple times I will only use the highest composite score for each individual.

Graduates from town/rural mix districts had the lowest percentage of individuals who didn’t take the ACT with 55.1%, followed by urban/town/rural mix with 58.1% and entirely rural with 63.8%.\n\n\nRUCA TableRUCA Cross-tabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n   Cell Contents\n|-------------------------|\n|                       N |\n|              Expected N |\n|           N / Row Total |\n|-------------------------|\n\n \nTotal Observations in Table:  49743 \n\n \n                                   | act.taken.ruca.cross.tabs$act.taken \nact.taken.ruca.cross.tabs$Dem_Desc | ACT not taken |     ACT taken |     Row Total | \n-----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n                    Entirely rural |          1164 |          1762 |          2926 | \n                                   |      1250.093 |      1675.907 |               | \n                                   |         0.398 |         0.602 |         0.059 | \n-----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n                    Town/rural mix |          5462 |          6344 |         11806 | \n                                   |      5043.948 |      6762.052 |               | \n                                   |         0.463 |         0.537 |         0.237 | \n-----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n              Urban/town/rural mix |         14626 |         20385 |         35011 | \n                                   |     14957.959 |     20053.041 |               | \n                                   |         0.418 |         0.582 |         0.704 | \n-----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n                      Column Total |         21252 |         28491 |         49743 | \n-----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n\n \nStatistics for All Table Factors\n\n\nPearson's Chi-squared test \n------------------------------------------------------------\nChi^2 =  83.70836     d.f. =  2     p =  6.652132e-19 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, here’s a look at the percentages by county.

Here are the columns and their definitions.\n\nEnrollmentBeginTimeID: Begin date for the student’s period of attendance.\nEnrollmentEndTimeID: End date for the student’s period of attendance.\nOPEID: Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE)/FICE code of the college that the student attended (Foreign Key to IPEDSCharacteristics).\nInstitutionName: Name of institution\nEnrollmentStatus: The last enrollment status reported for the student. This field will have ‘N/A’ or “NULL” if the reporting college has not defined the student’s enrollment status as directory information. Here are the code definitions;\n\nF: Full-time\nQ: Three-quarter time\nH: Half-time\nL: Less than half-time\nA: Leave of absence\nW: Withdrawn\nD: Deceased\n\n\nEssentially, this dataset provides semester-based information - each observation is a semester/single period with the institutional information and beginning and end time of that single period (usually a semester). For example, if an individual attended South Dakota State University, attended in a “typical” fashion (fall and spring semesters), and graduated in 4 years, there would be 8 observations for that PersonID - one observation per semester.\nThe primary pieces of information I want from this dataset is each year a PersonID was attending a post-secondary institution. So let’s shrink the dataset down to just the following columns;\n\nPersonID\nunique year attending a post-secondary institution\n\nThe PersonID will be filtered using the EnrollmentStatus variable equaling full-time, three-quarter time, half-time, and less than half-time.\nFor the unique year, it won’t matter how many semesters they were attending. If an individual attended half a year, then worked full-time, my meaningful employment definition should pick it up and transfer it into that category.

There are a couple of things to highlight.\n\nThe percentage of individuals that have meaningful employment is highest when looking at the county level in the early years after high school graduation. However, by 6 years after graduating, the percentage of individuals that graduated from a Southwest high school that have meaningful employment in Minnesota, but outside of the Southwest region balloons to nearly 21%, dwarfing all other meaningful employment within the Southwest region.\nNot surprisingly, a very large majority of individuals (62%) attend post-secondary education the year they graduate high school and that declines steadily over the following 4 to 6 years.\nThe proportion of individuals that are employed but not meaningful, and are not attending post-secondary remains steady throughout the grad.year.x; ~15%.\nThe proportion of individuals that do not have a MN employment record and are not attending a post-secondary institution increases significantly by 4 years after graduation. By 11 years after graduation, over 36% of the individuals are in this category.\n\n\n\n\n [1] \"PersonID\"       \"hs.grad.year\"   \"grad.year\"      \"county.match\"  \n [5] \"edr.match\"      \"region.match\"   \"Dem_Desc.match\" \"state.match\"   \n [9] \"ps.attend\"      \"states\"        \n\n\n [1] \"PersonID\"                       \"TimeID\"                        \n [3] \"EmploymentOrganizationID\"       \"EmployeeQuarterlyHoursWorked\"  \n [5] \"EmployeeQuarterlyWages\"         \"EmployeeTenure\"                \n [7] \"IndustryID\"                     \"USIndustryCode\"                \n [9] \"GroupCode\"                      \"OwnershipCode\"                 \n[11] \"EmployerLocationTotalWagesPaid\" \"QuarterlyAverageEmployment\"    \n[13] \"County\"                         \"CountyName\"                    \n[15] \"MNCounty\"                       \"City\"                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this I think there are 3 primary time.x that we should consider;\ngrad.year.1 = one year after graduating high school grad.year.5 = six years after graduating high school grad.year.10 = eleven years after graduating"

Here are the descriptions for each of the columns.\n\nK12AsstTimeID: Day, month, and year the assessment took place.\nTestName: Name of the test taken. There are 12 different tests in the dataset -\n\nACCESS: English proficiency,\nALTACCESS: English proficiency for special education or meet requirements\nMCA-II & MCA-III: Minnesota Comprehsensive Assessments (series 2 and 3)\nMOD-II, MOD-III: Modified Comprehensive Assessment, used only until 2014\nMTAS & MTAS-III: Minnesota Test of Academic Skills\nMTELL: an alternate assessment for students learning English (like the MTAS or MOD). MTELL was only administered from 2007-2010 during the series-II of MCAs.\nSOLOM: Minnesota Student Oral Language Observation Matrix\nTEAE: one of two assessments that Minnesota used to meet the requirements to test ELs in all four domains of language (the other was SOLOM). TEAE was used 2002 until we changed to ACCESS in 2012. SOLOM was used 2004 until we changed to ACCESS in 2012.\n\nSubject: Classifies each test that is given to a student based on the areas measured. There are 8 factors;\n\nA: Aural (listening) - ACCESS & ALTACCESS only\nC: Composite - ACCESS & ALTACCESS only\nL: Listening/Speaking\nM: Math\nO: Oral - ACCESS & ALTACCESS only\nR: Reading\nS: Science\nW: Writing\n\nGradeTested: Grade student was enrolled in when performing assessment.\nAchievementLevel: Used to count the number of students in each achievement level by group such as race, gender, and ethnicity. It must be calculated from other students at a similar graden and subject for a specific year.\n\nACCESS students are graded on a language proficiency scale of 1 through 6.\nALT-ACCESS students are graded using a P1 through P3 and A1 through A3 scale.\nThere are 4 different levels for the MCA test\n\nD: Does not meet standards\nE: Exceeds standards\nM: Meets Standards\nP: Partially meets standards\n\nSOLOM tests are 1-5 scale with 5 being the highest\nTEAE tests are 1-5 scale with 5 being the highest.\n\n\nThere are two ways in which we are going to code our graduates.\nThe first is to identify whether a student has been identified as an English learner. This means filtering students that have taken the ACCESS, ALT-ACCESS, MTELL, MTAS, TEAE, MOD-II, MOD-III, or SOLOM at least once in their career.\nThe second is be determining their highest achievement level in each subject of the MCA tests within the dataset. The dataset provides each instance of a test for each student so many are students are listed numerous times - once for each time they took a test.\nLets do this in two separate files and then join each with the master file.\nStarting with identifying the EL students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nenglish.learner\n\n\n\n\n11900797\n1\n\n\n5028261\n1\n\n\n3317469\n1\n\n\n3035228\n1\n\n\n637352\n1\n\n\n10025775\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nenglish.learner\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset identified 34,995 individuals who were identified as an english learner at least one time in the original dataset.\nNow we will determine the highest achievement level for each subject for each student.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nMCA.M\nMCA.R\nMCA.S\n\n\n\n\n7331360\n4\n4\n4\n\n\n11301019\n3\n3\n3\n\n\n8244901\n2\n3\n1\n\n\n2211485\n4\n4\n4\n\n\n2323416\n4\n4\n4\n\n\n2960983\n4\n4\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nMCA.M\n\n\nMCA.R\n\n\nMCA.S\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset has 495,034 rows and 4 columns.

For one particular class, it was consistently labeled “Information Technology” even though the field requires a number value. In addition, “information Technology” doesn’t seem to match the course due to the following information;\nProgram Course Name: Family and Consumer Science Course title: Apparrel CareerCluster: Design CareerClusterName: 6 (which should be a letter value, not a code).\nDue to this information, I recoded anything that was “Information Technology” for that particular course as a “6”.\nIn addition, there were some errors in careercluster 26, which is supposed to be “Administrative only” but had a number of “Youth Apprenticeships” in it that I recoded to CareerCluster 25.\nAfter doing this, the dataset has all individuals/graduates with a column for each CTE course CareerCluster containing the number of courses they took within that CareerCluster. I will summarise below to see how many students took courses within each CareerCluster.\nNow lets join the CTE enrollment data with the master dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nK12OrganizationID\nOrganizationName\ncounty.name\ncountyfp\nDem_Desc\nedr\ngrad.year\ngrad.year.covid\nGender\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\nHomelessIndicator\neconomic.status\npseo.participant\nSpecialEdStatus\nnon.english.home\nRaceEthnicity\nn.years.attended\nACTCompositeScore\nap.exam\ntotal.cte.courses.taken\nACTE-SPED\nAgriculture, Food, and Natural Resources\nArchitecture & Construction\nArts, A/V Technology & Communication\nBusiness, Management & Administrative\nDiversified\nEducation & Training\nFinance\nGovernment & Public Administration\nHealth Science\nHospitality & Tourism\nHuman Services\nInformation Technology\nLaw, Public Safety & Security\nManufacturing\nMarketing\nProgram Area (Diversified)\nScience, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics\nSTEM\nTransportation, Distribution & Logistics\nWork Experience-Handicapped\nWork Experience-Handicapped (16-20+ on IEP)\nWork Experience/Career Exploration (age 14-15 on I\nWork-Experience-Disadvantaged\nYouth Apprenticeship\n\n\n\n\n6140596\n15068\nCHERRY SECONDARY\nSt. Louis\n137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2017\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nY\n1\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n4\n15\n0\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1986818\n207340\nALC Independent Study\nSt. Louis\n137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2022\nPost-covid grad\nM\nN\nY\n0\n0\n0\n0\nUnknown\n2\nNA\n0\n7\n0\n0\n1\n0\n2\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n11614284\n217881\nGRAND RAPIDS SENIOR HIGH\nItasca\n061\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2023\nPost-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\n0\n0\n0\nUnknown\n3\nNA\n0\n4\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n8332752\n67509\nEAST HIGH SCHOOL\nSt. Louis\n137\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2016\nPre-covid grad\nM\nN\nN\n0\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n3\n26\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n6569729\n49396\nAITKIN SECONDARY SCHOOL\nAitkin\n001\nEntirely rural\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2012\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n3\n24\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n357415\n184119\nWRENSHALL SECONDARY\nCarlton\n017\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 3 - Arrowhead\n2019\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n3\n22\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nK12OrganizationID\n\n\nOrganizationName\n\n\ncounty.name\n\n\ncountyfp\n\n\nDem_Desc\n\n\nedr\n\n\ngrad.year\n\n\ngrad.year.covid\n\n\nGender\n\n\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\n\n\nHomelessIndicator\n\n\neconomic.status\n\n\npseo.participant\n\n\nSpecialEdStatus\n\n\nnon.english.home\n\n\nRaceEthnicity\n\n\nn.years.attended\n\n\nACTCompositeScore\n\n\nap.exam\n\n\ntotal.cte.courses.taken\n\n\nACTE-SPED\n\n\nAgriculture, Food, and Natural Resources\n\n\nArchitecture & Construction\n\n\nArts, A/V Technology & Communication\n\n\nBusiness, Management & Administrative\n\n\nDiversified\n\n\nEducation & Training\n\n\nFinance\n\n\nGovernment & Public Administration\n\n\nHealth Science\n\n\nHospitality & Tourism\n\n\nHuman Services\n\n\nInformation Technology\n\n\nLaw, Public Safety & Security\n\n\nManufacturing\n\n\nMarketing\n\n\nProgram Area (Diversified)\n\n\nScience, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics\n\n\nSTEM\n\n\nTransportation, Distribution & Logistics\n\n\nWork Experience-Handicapped\n\n\nWork Experience-Handicapped (16-20+ on IEP)\n\n\nWork Experience/Career Exploration (age 14-15 on I\n\n\nWork-Experience-Disadvantaged\n\n\nYouth Apprenticeship\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter joining the CTE enrollment data with the master dataset we continue to have 49,743 with an updated number of 46 columns."

    "text": "Summary - Number of CTE courses taken by a student\n\nWe’ll start with summarising the number of cte courses the observations have taken.\nThe tables below show that the average number of CTE courses taken by all PersonID in the master dataset is 2.22 with a standard deviation of +/-2.33. This is a high standard deviation meaning there are values quite far from the mean.\nThe second row of the table shows the average number of CTE courses taken by individuals who took at least one CTE course. The average jumps up a bit to 3.15 with a standard deviation of 2.19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the distribution of CTE courses taken by individuals. This shows that a a large majority of students take 10 courses or less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp next is to see if the percentage of students taking a CTE course varies significantly by RUCA group.\nThere is a significant difference in whether a student has taken at least one CTE course and their high school county RUCA category. Although 71% of all graduates took at least one CTE course, that percentage is highest in more rural districts. 86.4% took at least one CTE course in entirely rural districts while 82.0% took at least one in town/rural mix districts. 66.1% took at least one in our urban/town/rural mix districts.\nOf those students that took at least 1 CTE course, the average number of CTE courses taken ranged from 3.9 in our entirely rural districts to 3.0 in urban/town/rural mix districts.\n\n\nRUCA TableRUCA Cross-tabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n   Cell Contents\n|-------------------------|\n|                       N |\n|              Expected N |\n|           N / Row Total |\n|-------------------------|\n\n \nTotal Observations in Table:  49743 \n\n \n                         | cte.yes.no.ruca$cte.yes \ncte.yes.no.ruca$Dem_Desc |        No |       Yes | Row Total | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n          Entirely rural |       419 |      2507 |      2926 | \n                         |   841.865 |  2084.135 |           | \n                         |     0.143 |     0.857 |     0.059 | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n          Town/rural mix |      2328 |      9478 |     11806 | \n                         |  3396.809 |  8409.191 |           | \n                         |     0.197 |     0.803 |     0.237 | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n    Urban/town/rural mix |     11565 |     23446 |     35011 | \n                         | 10073.326 | 24937.674 |           | \n                         |     0.330 |     0.670 |     0.704 | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n            Column Total |     14312 |     35431 |     49743 | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n\n \nStatistics for All Table Factors\n\n\nPearson's Chi-squared test \n------------------------------------------------------------\nChi^2 =  1080.465     d.f. =  2     p =  2.398867e-235"

    "text": "Summary - CareerCluster of CTE courses taken\nLet’s dig into the breadth of CTE course concentrations a graduate would take by looking at the proportion of graduates that took at least one course within a concentration.\nThe table below shows that a third of all graduates took a CTE course in Transportation, Distribution & Logistics, followed by 19% in Manufacturing, and 15% in each Architecture & Construction and Human Services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will take a look at the breakdown of the number of times a CTE courses has been taken within a CareerCluster for each PersonID. I expect there to be a lot of variation in this data since different schools might focus on different types of CTE offerings depending on the local employment makeup.\nFirst, lets look at the concentrations of courses taken across CareerClusters.\nNot surprisingly, Transportation, Distribution & Logistics was the careercluster with the highest percentage of courses taken with 20.6%. This was followed by manfacturing with 12.4% and architecture and construction with 11.2% of CTE courses taken in that CareerCluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets see how this looks broken down by county.\nThe county maps do show some differences in percentages across career clusters. Manufacturing was consistently offered and taken across the region, as well as transportation, distribution and logistics and Human Services.\nKoochiching has a high percentage of students that take health science & health occupations as well as human services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next big question is whether these percentages vary by year. Are there any trends?\nThis is honestly a bit surprising. The chart raises a couple of questions.\nThere was a big increase in the transportation, distribution and logistics career cluster in the mid-2010s but has declined substantially since that time. Health science and health occupations has been growing steadily as well as architecture and construction."

It looks like each observation is unique by grade of the student. This means that one PersonID can have multiple observations.\nIn order to determine how I want to organize this data so that each observation represents the full characteristics of each PersonID I need to understand how these values are defined.\n\nBasic Participant: Any grade 9-12 student who successfully completes one or more state-approved CTE course(s).\nBasic Concentrator: this is the old standard for years and required the student complete 240 hours. Any student successfully enrolled in a single CTE field for more than 240 hours (successful is defined as passing grade).\nBasic Completor: any concentrator who attains academic and technical knowledge and skills and graduates from high school.\nConcentrator 150: This is the new standard - Any grade 9-12 student who successfully completes 150+ course hours (or more) as part of a state-approved secondary CTE program, within one career field.\n\nJudging by these definitions, it seems that we will want three categories;\n\nThose that participated in a CTE course but were not a concentrator or a completor, and\nThose that participated in a CTE course and graduated as a concentrator.\nThose that did not participate in a CTE course.\n\nSo essentially, filtering this dataset to provide the “highest level achieved” in terms of CTE coursework.

As expected, Male and Female are opposite of each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s turn this into a bar plot to better visualize all of these.
